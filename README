node-irc-bot-3
==============

Like the third time I'm remaking node-irc-bot. At least I like it this time :D

## Running

Here's how:

    $ npm install q yamljs eventemitter2 underscore
    $ node ircbot

## Configuring

First, copy `configs.example.yml` into `configs.yml`.
The [YAML][yaml] configuration file has comments inside - go read them! :D

[yaml]: http://www.yaml.org/

## Making modules

There's two kinds - one that hooks straight into event streams, and another that 
uses the "commands" event stream alone, which is more straight-forward (since commands
are well documented) and brings with it stability. 

To find out more about the 'event' kind, go check out `modules/module-logging.js`.   
To find out more about the 'command' kind, go check out `modules/module-test.js`.  

I've written a bunch of stuff into these two files about the specific module kinds, and
these files are a good starting point for future modules.

## Todo

[ ] Extra secrets
[ ] Command interpolation (eg `\hug {mangler.rot13 {mangler.rot13 boxmein}}`)
[ ] Global permissions
[ ] Reloadable 'event'-type modules
[ ] TPT module: user- and moderator-level tools to do stuff :D
[ ] Segregating the huge "ircbot.js" file (do I need this?)
